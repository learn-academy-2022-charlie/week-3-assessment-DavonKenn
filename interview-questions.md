1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: In javascript this is a method used to describe an object.I remember using this.state on a treasure hunt project naming key value pairs as such as board following along with an instructor Sarah at LEARN.

  Researched answer:The value of this is decided based on how the code is being executed.When an object’s method is invoked, then this refers to the object which contains the method being invoked.In javascript this refers to a particular object. I remember using this.state on a treasure hunt project naming key value pairs as such as board following along with an instructor Sarah at LEARN.



2. What is React? Why would you use it?

In HTML multiple elements can be returned.
  HTML elements have attributes JSX elements have props. Creating a food menu challenge I used both HTML and JSX. HTML to create a list of bar food and drinks.JSX to create a function that showed the cost and taxes rounded.

6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer:An anonymouse function is a function without a name.

  Researched answer:An anonymous function is a function without a name.The open parathesis makes the anonymous function an expression that returns a function object.An anonymous function is not accessible after its initial creation. Therefore, you often need to assign it to a variable.
